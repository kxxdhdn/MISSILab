  ~gaussLine_w~ was added to make wave-in-nu-out possible (which is the idea here), while it rose a confusion when doing normalization test. 
  Finally, the merger of this option lead to a LOGICAL "w2nu", .TRUE. when input is wavelength, because the profiles will be used to fit the obs curves in function of nu whose intensities Fnu are in W/m2/Hz (Jy). 
  Idem. for lorentzBand & extCurve
