** REPORT fitHBsyn
- Note taken on [2020-09-24 Thu 17:39] \\
  Bad fit, probably due to the problem of ~specModel_gen~ \rarr add ~test_gsamp~

** KNOWNCAUSE fitChi2

  1. Very slow, should add timers; 
  2. Should be able to block and retake at a certain pixel; 
  3. Discontinuity at 20 microns; 
  4. ALL(mask(x,y,:)) or ANY(mask(x,y,:)) ? should allow lacking of isolated wvl (diff from the case of lacking the whole module); 
  5. Diagonal covar matrix used (for now); 
  6. Add calib error
  7. Check if there is at least one wvl available in center \pm width/2 region for every line/band
  8. Save all param (incl. fixed ones) in h5 file

  ~gaussLine_w~ was added to make wave-in-nu-out possible (which is the idea here), while it rose a confusion when doing normalization test. 
  Finally, the merger of this option lead to a LOGICAL "w2nu", .TRUE. when input is wavelength, because the profiles will be used to fit the obs curves in function of nu whose intensities Fnu are in W/m2/Hz (Jy). 
  Idem. for lorentzBand & extCurve

  [via Fred]
  1. Do not read extcurve file everytime -> call it only once at the beginning
  2. Do not do interpolation in func modifBB -> interpolate Qabs once and for all (add optional input "waveall" in ~make_Qabs~)
